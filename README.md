## Overview

Translate the selected text into other languages.

The plugin uses [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator), a free neural machine translation service.

DeepL is compatible with [self-hosted](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer) and [desktop](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors) versions of ONLYOFFICE editors. It can be added to ONLYOFFICE instances manually.

## How to use

1. Select the text you want to translate.

2. Go to the Plugins tab and click on DeepL.

3. Choose yor target language.

4. Alternatively, you can insert text for translation manually. To do so, click Enter text manually on the left panel. Type new text in the field that appears or edit already selected text (this will only affect the translation, the original text will remain unchanged).

5. Use the Copy button to copy the translation and the Replace button to replace the selected text with its translation.

## How to install

Detailed instructions can be found in [ONLYOFFICE API documentation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/plugin/installation).
